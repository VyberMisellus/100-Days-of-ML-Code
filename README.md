# 100-Days-of-ML-Code
A little side-project to try to delve into the realm of machine learning.
## Scraping
Using APIs such as PRAW and basc_py4chan to scrape data (images, posts) for the sake of figuring out how to manipulate it. This goes along with the traditional html scraping with BeautifulSoup4, which is useful for more general website data scraping.
## Data Prep and Modeling
Given most projects here use images (.wav files make an appearance as well), a grabIms() function (written using scipy methods) is repeatedly used throughout most models, as there is emphasis on simplified, organized programs that load data, process it, and send it to an ML model all in one file.
## Endgame
Given such an emphasis on image and audio generation, two engames are afoot: One is unsupervised image segmentation, and the other is art generation using tradition ML models.
## Going Further...
At the end of the ordeal, there will still be models uploaded and created, just not as a part of the 100DOMLC.

# 100-Days-of-ML-Code
A little side-project to try to classify monologue according to their "moods."

The initial file, moodScraper.py will scrape all posts from relevant subreddits that are classified as "mood" subreddits (i.e. depression, angry) and save all posts to local directories, where posts are saved under their id, and comments are 'tagged' for parsing later on.
